ECHO is on.
"You miss 100% of the shots you dont take." 
"aim for the moon if you miss you will land among the stars." 
"no one ever regrets spending too much time with family." 
"dwelling on yesterday will not change tommorow." 
"the future holds no gurantees." 
"the future belongs to those who did the work today."
